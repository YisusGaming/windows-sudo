## Installation
<h3 style="display: inline;">First</h3>, download the "<code>windows-sudo</code>" zip file from the release you're planning to use.

Once you've downloaded the file, unzip it. After, you should see a folder with the `.exe` file inside.

To complete the installation, you could add the unzipped folder to your `path`.

## Usage
> <!> If you haven't installed the program, please follow the [installation](#installation) guide first.

The program is very easy to use and once installed it can be used right away.

```bash
sudo [options] <program>
```
That's the structure the program expects you to pass in arguments.
